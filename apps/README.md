# Applications and User Platforms for your Qroma project


## Getting Started

If you think web app development is chaotic, you haven't seen anything yet. Smartphone app frameworks try to tame the myriad of operating systems and form factors with "generic" APIs and design tools and formats for arbitrary screen sizes. For Qroma projects, we are keeping things simple at the UI level, focusing on declaring intent, and making sure communication is possible. 

Assuming you'd want to host content yourself, with the Android platform, there is always the option to self-host and sideload APK files.

We will also let you leverage Qromatech infrastructure to use your project's IO declarations in the Qromatech smartphone app so that Bluetooth communication can be leveraged anywhere you have your device and your smartphone together.


## Rationale

Smartphone apps are one of the riskiest parts of this effort. App stores have strict submission policies, the smartphone apps themselves are not as forgiving to debug and deploy to as websites, and iOS requires proprietary tooling. The future of the app store monopoly is also uncertain due to anti-trust litigation that could have far-reaching effects. So while we wouldn't discourage you from trying to create a smartphone app, there's not a lot of sense in providing a general purpose, app-store publishable template for hobbyists and Makers other than what you'd be able to host yourself.
