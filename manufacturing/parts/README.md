# Parts

The goal of this directory is to keep all the assets associated with the physical version of the product in one place and "compilable".

What's listed in this directory is just a first pass attempt to organize data. Don't get too attached to how things are laid out. But some major areas to consider will include:
* Assemblies - These are groups of parts that can be held/stored together as logical units. The final assembly can be made of multiple sub-assemblies.
* Electronics - These can be custom boards (and their designs), commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts, connectors, and individual electronic components.
* Enclosures - These are containers that house parts and could enclose assemblies.
* Jigs - These are parts that are used in the construction of the system, but are not part of the final assembly.
