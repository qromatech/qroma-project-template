# Manufacturing

The goal of this directory is to keep all of the assets associated with the physical version of the product in one place and "compilable".

Example design tools can generate information to include with a project. Some examples include:
* 3D print/part files/assets
  * Design files/source code (e.g. Fusion 360 files, OpenSCAD files, etc.)
  * 3D renders
  * STL files
  * GCode/machine production instructions
* Laser cutter files/assets
  * Design files/source code
  * Images
  * GCode/machine production instructions
* KiCAD files
  * PCB production files
  * Circuit diagrams
  * Schematics


Once you have assemblies, it should theoretically be possible to generate a bill of materials (either part purchase links, instructions for creating parts, or links/services to create the parts) from an accurate list of project assets. As such, being able to edit, update, and recompile a project in a "timely" fashion will be critical!
