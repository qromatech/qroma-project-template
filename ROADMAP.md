# Qroma Roadmap

A place for jotting down feature ideas for later versions of the Qroma Device Project System (DPS).


### Open Source

As Makers get more connected and educated, Open Source versions of traditionally proprietary processes continue to gain traction. The primary benefit of commercial tooling will be that their existing user base doesn't have to change their workflow and the integrated, locked-in workflows that already exist. It seems like many of these commercial offerings are moving their services to the cloud to become systems of record and make sharing without the tools themselves invisible and harder to extricate from workflows. It remains to be seen if this strategy will be successful in the long run or if the benefits that these tools have demonstrated will be widespread enough that individuals with the capabilities and inclination (or more open-source friendly organizations) to make alternative options will replicate/improve upon these already existing offerings.

### Simulators

As parts become assemblies, in theory everything should be simulatable together (software, device I/O, enclosure and part interactions). That would be awesome.
